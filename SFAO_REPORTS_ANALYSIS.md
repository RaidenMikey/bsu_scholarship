# üìä SFAO Reports Analysis: Campus Selection & Central View

## üéØ **SFAO Report Creation Process**

### **1. Campus Selection Logic**
When SFAO creates reports, they can select from campuses under their jurisdiction:

#### **Campus Hierarchy:**
- **Constituent Campus** - Main campus with SFAO admin
- **Extension Campuses** - Satellite campuses under the constituent campus

#### **Selection Options:**
```php
// SFAO can create reports for:
$monitoredCampuses = $campus->getAllCampusesUnder();
// Includes: [Constituent Campus] + [All Extension Campuses]
```

#### **Example Campus Structure:**
- **Campus A (Constituent)** - Main campus with SFAO admin
  - **Campus A Extension 1** - Satellite campus
  - **Campus A Extension 2** - Satellite campus
  - **Campus A Extension 3** - Satellite campus

### **2. Report Data Generation**
When SFAO selects a specific campus, the system generates comprehensive data for that campus and its extensions.

#### **Example Campus Analysis:**
```
Campus A (Constituent):
- Total Applications: 150
- Approved: 120
- Approval Rate: 80%
- Status: Good

Campus A Extension 1:
- Total Applications: 45
- Approved: 30
- Approval Rate: 67%
- Status: Fair

Campus A Extension 2:
